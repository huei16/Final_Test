                <h3> 01. What is Code  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/ ">🔍</a></h3>
                <p> I think this sentence captured the complexity of codes: A language is software for making software. Just learning html and CSS is already so complicated for me, and there could be coders who know very well multiple languages mentioned in the article. I think getting to know about coding makes me really appreciate other coders’ effort for creating all sorts of software that forms my daily life.</p>

                <h3> 02. What Screens Want  <a target="_blank" href="https://frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/  ">🔍</a></h3>
                <p> When Frank Chimero is comparing of between flat screen objects or if they should mimic an actual 3D object, he said, it’s just aesthetic. I also think they’re incomparable because they were introduced under different generation of screens and people had different perceptions. Digital elements were designed to look analog when they were first introduced, so it’s easier for people to understand; but now, we’re so used to digital interfaces, is it necessary for the graphics to look analog? As I noticed how apple and Google interfaces are all becoming more and more “flat” each time we update, I assume the existence of 3D and flat design is just because there were different needs.</p>

                <h3> 03. Vernacular Web  <a target="_blank" href="http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/">🔍</a></h3>
                <p> At the very beginning, the author pointed straight out that the article will be about web pages in the 1990s. I thought the retro look was on purpose at first, but after noticing that some of the links are outdated and not working, I thought, “how old is this website?” It’s from 2005! This just reminds me how rapidly the Internet and digital media changes. Olia is critiquing webs made a decade ago from her, yet her article is also a decade ago from us already.</p>

                <h3> 04. Jodi's Infrastructure  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/74/59810/jodi-s-infrastructure/">🔍</a></h3>
                <p>Jodi’s art is very visual to me, they challenge the regular way we think about code or web elements, but for me, the meaning of those elements were kind of taken away. I am more interested in the concept of internationalized domain; I wonder if the web will be more inclusive in the future.</p>
